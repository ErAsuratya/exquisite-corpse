    <h1>A crazy story</h1>
    <p>According to Hindu scriptures, Lord Ram was born on the the day of Ram Navami. After the increase of iniquity, 
        Lord Bishnu, who came to earth as "Ram", killed Ravana. But many do not know that Ravan's death was possible due to 
        a small mistake. Else, even Lord Ram could not have killed him..</p>
