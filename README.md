# Ramayan (A tale of Ram)

    According to Hindu scriptures, Lord Ram was born on the the day of Ram Navami. After the increase of iniquity, Lord Bishnu, who came to earth as "Ram", killed Ravana. But many do not know that Ravan's death was possible due to a small mistake. Else, even Lord Ram could not have killed him.

## Ravan invited his death due to his small mistake
    King of Lanka "Ravan" wanted to conquer the whole world. But he knew that his dream could not come true without god's blessings. So he began to do great penance to please hus anestor god Brahma.

    Even after so many years of penance, Brahma was not pleased and thus didnot appear before Ravan. Then Ravan began to intensify his penance. He cut off his head and began to offer it to Brahma. As, Ravan was the son of Brahma, he used to grow as many heads as he could.

    After Ravan cut off his 10 heads and offered them, Brahmaji was pleased and appeared before Ravan. Brahma said -" Oh my child! I am pleased with your hard work. What blessings do you want from me? Ask!"
